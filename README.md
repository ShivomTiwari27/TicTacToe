# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The game includes basic win detection and the option to play again after a game concludes.

### The challenge

The challenge was to create an interactive and visually appealing Tic Tac Toe game that responds well to user input and provides feedback based on game results.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout
- JavaScript for game logic and interactivity
- CSS Media Queries for responsive design

### What I learned

In this project, I reinforced my understanding of:

- **JavaScript Event Handling:** Used event listeners to handle user interactions with the game grid.
- **CSS Grid Layout:** Utilized CSS Grid for organizing the Tic Tac Toe board into a 3x3 layout.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured the game is playable and visually appealing on various screen sizes using media queries.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:

- Add AI for a single-player mode.
- Enhance the UI with animations and sound effects.
- Implement a scoring system to track wins, losses, and draws over multiple rounds.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - Helped with understanding and implementing the grid layout for the game board.
- [MDN Web Docs - JavaScript Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) - Provided guidance on handling user interactions in JavaScript.
